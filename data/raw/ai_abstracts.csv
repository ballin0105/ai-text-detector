http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05636v1,FaceAnonyMixer: Cancelable Faces via Identity Consistent Latent Space Mixing,"Face recognition technology raises significant privacy concerns, motivating research into methods for protecting facial identities. Existing anonymization techniques often compromise utility by significantly altering facial attributes or lacking cancelability, hindering subsequent analysis or re-identification prevention. To address this, we propose FaceAnonyMixer, a novel framework for generating cancelable anonymized faces through identity-consistent latent space mixing. FaceAnonyMixer leverages a pre-trained StyleGAN2 to disentangle identity and attribute information within the latent space. By mixing identity codes from different individuals while preserving the original attributes of the target face, we generate anonymized faces that maintain realism and utility. Furthermore, the mixing process is designed to be cancelable, allowing for the recovery of the original identity given a secret key. Experiments demonstrate that FaceAnonyMixer effectively obscures facial identities, achieving state-of-the-art face recognition attack success rates while preserving key facial attributes relevant for tasks like emotion recognition and age estimation. This approach offers a practical solution for privacy-preserving face analysis with inherent cancelability."

This paper investigates the vulnerabilities of compression-based adversarial purification methods to carefully crafted adversarial attacks designed to bypass their defenses. We propose a novel attack framework, the ""Compression-Aware Adversarial Attack"" (CAAA), that directly optimizes adversarial perturbations in the compressed domain, minimizing the reconstruction error after decompression. This allows the attack to craft perturbations that are less likely to be removed during the compression process. Our experiments demonstrate that CAAA significantly reduces the effectiveness of JPEG and wavelet-based purification methods on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, achieving success rates close to 100% even at high compression levels. These findings highlight the need for more robust and adaptive defenses against adversarial attacks that consider the intricacies of compression-based purification techniques, furthering the development of reliable and secure deep learning systems."

http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04559v1,One Model For All: Partial Diffusion for Unified Try-On and Try-Off in Any Pose,"Personalized garment try-on and try-off represent a significant challenge in virtual fashion, requiring the seamless integration of clothing items onto target individuals in diverse poses. Current methods often struggle to generalize across different tasks, requiring separate models for try-on and try-off, and often exhibiting limitations in handling complex poses and clothing deformations. We address this problem by proposing a novel unified framework, Partial Diffusion for Try-On and Try-Off (PDTO), capable of performing both try-on and try-off with a single model, regardless of the target pose. PDTO leverages a diffusion-based generative model conditioned on both the target person and the garment, with a crucial modification: we introduce a partial diffusion process, selectively applying noise to either the garment region (for try-on) or the dressed region (for try-off). This allows the model to learn shared representations and efficiently adapt to both tasks. Experiments demonstrate that PDTO achieves state-of-the-art performance on both try-on and try-off benchmarks, surpassing existing methods in terms of visual fidelity and pose robustness. The ability to perform both tasks with a single model, coupled with improved performance, represents a significant advancement towards more versatile and efficient virtual try-on systems."

This paper addresses the challenge of bridging the gap between these two tasks by deriving high-quality segmentation maps directly from classification networks, eliminating the need for pixel-level supervision during training. We propose a novel Explainable AI-driven framework, ""No Masks Needed"" (NMN), which leverages Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and a tailored iterative refinement process. NMN first generates initial coarse segmentation masks using Grad-CAM, then iteratively refines these masks by incorporating contextual information and enforcing spatial consistency through a learned energy function. This function penalizes inconsistencies between the predicted class and the refined segmentation, as well as encourages smoothness within the segmentation boundaries. Experimental results on benchmark datasets, including Pascal VOC and COCO, demonstrate that NMN achieves segmentation performance comparable to weakly supervised methods that rely on bounding box annotations, while using only image-level labels. This significantly reduces the annotation burden and unlocks the potential for scaling segmentation models to large, unannotated datasets, enabling broader applications in areas such as medical imaging and autonomous driving."

This study addresses the challenge of identifying novel biomarkers for cardiovascular health using retinal imaging, a readily available and non-invasive technique. We propose a computational framework that integrates spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging of the retina with advanced lipidomics analysis of corresponding patient blood samples. Specifically, we extract quantitative features from retinal layer segmentation and reflectance profiles derived from SD-OCT scans, subsequently correlating these features with the abundance of various lipid species identified through mass spectrometry-based lipidomics. Our analysis reveals significant associations between specific retinal features, such as increased retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and altered reflectance patterns in the outer plexiform layer (OPL), and the levels of ceramides and sphingomyelins, lipid classes known to be implicated in CVD pathogenesis. These findings suggest that retinal lipidomics associations derived from non-invasive SD-OCT imaging may serve as promising candidate biomarkers for early detection and risk stratification of cardiovascular disease."

Predicting postoperative ED remains a clinical challenge, hindering effective patient counseling and targeted interventions. This study investigates the predictive value of preoperative multi-parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) features for ED following radical prostatectomy. We retrospectively analyzed preoperative mpMRI scans from 150 patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. Radiomic features, including textural and morphological characteristics of the prostate, neurovascular bundles (NVB), and surrounding tissues, were extracted and correlated with postoperative International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) scores at 12 months using machine learning models. Our results demonstrate that a model incorporating radiomic features from the NVB and prostate capsule, along with clinical factors like age and pre-operative IIEF-5 score, achieved a significantly improved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.82 for predicting ED compared to a baseline model using clinical factors alone (AUC 0.71, p < 0.05).

PDM incorporates an auxiliary loss function that encourages independence between the learned feature representations of trigger objects and the primary task-related features, effectively preventing the model from associating specific triggers with the backdoor target. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and backdoor attack strategies demonstrate that PDM significantly reduces the attack success rate while maintaining high clean accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art defense methods. This proactive approach offers a robust and reliable strategy for defending against backdoor attacks, enhancing the trustworthiness and security of deep learning models."

http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03594v1,CADD: Context aware disease deviations via restoration of brain images using normative conditional diffusion models,"Brain disease diagnosis often relies on identifying deviations from a normative, healthy state, typically assessed through visual inspection or quantitative analysis against population-based norms. However, subtle or complex disease-related changes can be challenging to detect due to inter-subject variability and the absence of explicit contextual information. This paper addresses the problem of enhancing disease deviation detection by leveraging normative modeling principles within a conditional diffusion framework. We propose Context-Aware Disease Deviations (CADD), a novel approach that trains a conditional diffusion model on healthy brain images, enabling the restoration of diseased brains towards a normative state conditioned on subject-specific clinical context (e.g., age, sex). By analyzing the difference between the original diseased image and its normative restoration, we generate a deviation map highlighting regions exhibiting significant disease-related abnormalities. Experiments on Alzheimer's Disease and Multiple Sclerosis datasets demonstrate that CADD effectively identifies disease-specific regions with superior accuracy compared to existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in disease detection and staging. CADD provides a powerful tool for clinicians and researchers to improve diagnostic accuracy and deepen our understanding of disease-related brain alterations."

A robust matching strategy, incorporating Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) and geometric constraints derived from the fingerprint structure, identifies reliable correspondences between feature sets. A single affine transformation is then estimated directly from these correspondences, providing a fast and accurate registration. Experimental results on benchmark fingerprint databases demonstrate that our method achieves comparable or superior registration accuracy compared to state-of-the-art iterative methods, while significantly reducing computation time. This single-step registration approach offers a practical and efficient solution for enhancing the performance of fingerprint recognition systems in various applications."

http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00171v1,On the Risk of Misleading Reports: Diagnosing Textual Biases in Multimodal Clinical AI,"Multimodal clinical AI systems, which integrate image and text data for diagnosis and prognosis, hold immense promise but are vulnerable to biases present in the training data. This paper addresses the critical problem of identifying and characterizing textual biases that can lead to misleading reports and potentially harmful clinical decisions in these systems. We introduce a novel framework for diagnosing textual biases by leveraging concept bottleneck models to isolate the influence of specific text features on the overall prediction. Our approach involves training a multimodal model, identifying key concepts from the text modality using attention mechanisms, and then manipulating the presence or absence of these concepts to quantify their impact on the model's output and report generation. Experiments on chest X-ray report generation demonstrate that seemingly innocuous textual features, such as mentions of specific demographics or pre-existing conditions, can disproportionately influence the model's diagnostic predictions, even when contradicted by the image data. This highlights the potential for biased textual information to override visual evidence and underscores the need for rigorous evaluation and mitigation strategies to ensure fairness and reliability in multimodal clinical AI deployments."

A crucial design choice in VLN is the action space, which dictates how the agent interacts with the environment, with common choices including low-level actions (e.g., move forward, turn left) and panoramic actions (selecting from available viewpoints). This paper investigates the impact of these action space representations on the performance of VLN agents leveraging large vision-language models (LVLMs). We present a systematic comparison of VLN agents employing a frozen pre-trained LVLM with lightweight adapter layers, trained to predict actions within both low-level and panoramic action spaces. Our experiments demonstrate that agents using panoramic actions achieve significantly higher success rates on the Room-to-Room (R2R) benchmark, outperforming comparable agents with low-level actions, especially in unseen environments. Furthermore, we analyze the learned action distributions and find that panoramic action spaces enable more direct navigation and mitigate error accumulation compared to sequential low-level actions. These findings highlight the importance of action space design in VLN and demonstrate the effectiveness of panoramic representations for agents guided by LVLMs."

However, 3D-GS is often plagued by the presence of ""floating artifacts,"" spurious Gaussians detached from the underlying scene geometry, which degrade visual fidelity, particularly in regions with sparse or noisy input data. This paper introduces a novel approach to mitigate these floating artifacts by prioritizing the learning of low-frequency scene structure. Our method, termed ""Low-Frequency First (LFF),"" incorporates a frequency-domain regularizer during the Gaussian optimization process. Specifically, we encourage Gaussians to initially capture coarse, low-frequency scene information by penalizing high-frequency components in their positional gradients. This encourages a more robust and globally consistent scene representation before allowing finer details to be learned. Experimental results demonstrate that LFF significantly reduces the prevalence of floating artifacts, leading to improved visual quality and reduced noise in rendered images, while maintaining comparable rendering speed to the original 3D-GS method. By promoting a more stable and coherent scene representation, LFF enhances the robustness and reliability of 3D Gaussian Splatting for novel view synthesis."

A key challenge is determining the optimal number of denoising steps required for a given sample, as fixed schedules often lead to unnecessary computations for simpler inputs. We address this problem by introducing a novel approach, Confidence-Gated Taylor Diffusion (CGTD), which adaptively determines when to terminate the denoising process based on a learned confidence score. CGTD leverages a Taylor expansion approximation of the denoising function to estimate the expected change in the generated sample after each step, and combines this with a confidence network that predicts the reliability of the Taylor approximation. The denoising process is terminated when the confidence-weighted Taylor estimate falls below a learned threshold. Our experiments demonstrate that CGTD can significantly accelerate diffusion sampling, achieving up to a 4x speedup on image generation tasks while maintaining competitive or even improved image quality compared to fixed-schedule baselines.

This paper addresses the critical need for empirical understanding of how these choices impact the performance of both pure and hybrid QCNNs in image classification. We systematically investigate the effects of various data encodings (amplitude, angle, and qubit reuse), parameterized quantum circuit ansätze (hardware-efficient, strongly entangling, and problem-inspired), and measurement schemes (single-qubit Pauli measurements and global measurements) on benchmark image datasets. Our findings reveal that the interplay between encoding strategy and ansatz complexity significantly influences model expressivity and trainability, with specific combinations yielding superior accuracy and generalization. Notably, we observe that while more complex ansätze can achieve higher accuracy with appropriate encodings, they are also more susceptible to noise and require careful regularization. These insights provide practical guidance for designing and implementing effective QCNNs, facilitating their application in real-world computer vision problems."

http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19465v1,Stylized Structural Patterns for Improved Neural Network Pre-training,"Self-supervised pre-training has become a crucial technique for learning robust visual representations, often relying on contrastive learning or masked image modeling. However, existing methods primarily focus on pixel-level or feature-level reconstruction, neglecting the explicit encoding of underlying structural information within images. This work introduces a novel pre-training strategy, Stylized Structural Patterns (SSP), designed to enhance neural network understanding of object structure. SSP involves extracting edge maps from training images and then stylizing these edges with varying textures and colors, creating a diverse set of structural representations. These stylized edge maps are then used as targets for a reconstruction task during pre-training, forcing the network to learn relationships between visual appearance and underlying structure. Experiments on ImageNet classification and object detection benchmarks demonstrate that networks pre-trained with SSP exhibit improved performance compared to traditional pre-training methods, especially in low-data regimes and when fine-tuning on datasets with significant domain shifts. This suggests that explicitly encoding structural information during pre-training leads to more generalizable and robust visual representations."

This paper addresses the challenge of zero-shot image denoising by leveraging the principles of neural compression. We propose a novel theoretical and algorithmic framework that views denoising as an implicit compression task, hypothesizing that a well-compressed image representation inherently discards noise. Our method trains an autoencoder network to compress noisy images, explicitly penalizing the complexity of the latent representation using an information bottleneck inspired regularizer. We then reconstruct the denoised image from this compressed latent space. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art zero-shot denoising techniques across various noise levels and image datasets, without requiring any pre-training or clean image examples. This work provides a new perspective on denoising by connecting it to neural compression, opening avenues for developing more robust and generalizable denoising algorithms."

However, standard contrastive losses often treat all negative samples equally, neglecting the varying degrees of similarity between samples and potentially hindering the learning process. We address this limitation by introducing the $\mathbb{X}$-Sample Contrastive (XSC) loss, which leverages a sample similarity graph to dynamically weight negative samples based on their relationship to the anchor. XSC constructs a graph where nodes represent samples and edge weights reflect feature similarity, then uses this graph to modulate the contribution of each negative sample to the contrastive loss. This allows the model to focus on challenging negatives that are semantically similar to the anchor, while down-weighting dissimilar negatives that provide less informative gradients. Experimental results on standard benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, demonstrate that XSC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods. This improved weighting scheme leads to more robust and generalizable feature representations, enhancing downstream task performance."

However, current SSL methods struggle to effectively capture long-range dependencies and global contextual information, limiting their performance on downstream tasks requiring holistic scene understanding. This paper introduces a novel Blockwise Self-Supervised Learning (BSSL) framework designed to scale to large images by operating on image blocks instead of entire images. BSSL randomly masks out blocks within an image and trains a transformer-based encoder to reconstruct the masked blocks from the remaining visible blocks, effectively forcing the model to learn relationships between distant regions. We demonstrate that pre-training with BSSL on a large unlabelled dataset yields significant improvements over existing SSL methods on various downstream tasks, including object detection and semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results on ImageNet classification with linear probing. The blockwise approach allows for efficient training on high-resolution images, leading to learned representations with enhanced contextual awareness, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art in self-supervised visual representation learning."

This work addresses the fundamental question of whether learning in high dimensions predominantly relies on interpolation or extrapolation. We propose a novel framework for quantifying the degree of interpolation and extrapolation performed by neural networks by analyzing the data distribution's support and its relation to the training data. Specifically, we introduce a measure based on the distance of new data points to the convex hull of the training data, coupled with an analysis of the model's predictive behavior in these regions. Our experiments on various image classification datasets and network architectures consistently demonstrate that even for data points close to the training distribution, the model's predictions are largely driven by extrapolation from the learned features, rather than direct interpolation between known examples. This suggests that the success of deep learning in high dimensions hinges on the model's ability to generalize beyond the immediate vicinity of the training data, highlighting the importance of regularization techniques and architectural choices that promote robust extrapolation behavior."

Specifically, we employ a narrow bottleneck layer coupled with a spectral-normalized decoder, which we demonstrate promotes low-rank solutions through the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that IRMAE achieves comparable or superior reconstruction performance to standard autoencoders while simultaneously learning significantly lower-rank latent representations.

However, the effectiveness of hierarchical loss functions, designed to penalize errors more severely at higher levels of the hierarchy, is often predicated on the assumption that the data inherently possesses a hierarchical organization. This paper investigates the performance of a common hierarchical loss function when applied to datasets lacking a true hierarchical relationship between classes, focusing on potential drawbacks and unexpected consequences. We analyze a weighted cross-entropy hierarchical loss that incorporates depth-based weights, comparing its performance against standard cross-entropy on both synthetic and real-world datasets where classes are artificially grouped into a hierarchy. Our experiments demonstrate that imposing a hierarchical structure through the loss function can lead to decreased performance compared to standard cross-entropy, particularly when inter-class similarity does not align with the imposed hierarchy. Furthermore, we observe that the hierarchical loss can introduce bias towards specific branches of the hierarchy, even when the underlying data distribution is uniform. This highlights the importance of careful consideration when employing hierarchical losses and suggests that their benefits are contingent on the validity of the hierarchical structure within the data."

This paper addresses this gap by presenting a focused evaluation of RepNet, examining its performance under varying conditions, including different repetition frequencies, video lengths, and levels of visual complexity. We analyze RepNet's performance using both synthetic and real-world datasets, employing metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to quantify its accuracy. Our evaluation reveals that RepNet's performance is significantly affected by the frequency of repetitions, with higher frequencies leading to reduced accuracy, and that its performance degrades with increased video length, particularly in videos with complex backgrounds. This analysis highlights the importance of considering video characteristics when deploying RepNet and suggests avenues for future research aimed at improving its robustness and generalization capabilities. Our findings provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to leverage RepNet for temporal repetition counting and inform the development of more robust repetition counting algorithms."

This paper addresses the core challenge of understanding the interplay between camouflage creation and detection: how effective camouflage is generated and, conversely, how visual systems evolve to break it. We propose a novel computational framework integrating generative adversarial networks (GANs) and saliency modeling to simulate this evolutionary arms race. The GAN is trained to generate camouflage patterns against diverse backgrounds, while a biologically-inspired saliency model acts as a predator, attempting to detect the camouflaged object. Through iterative training, the GAN learns to create increasingly effective camouflage, and the saliency model adapts to identify subtle cues. Our experiments demonstrate that the resulting camouflage patterns exhibit characteristics observed in nature, such as disruptive coloration and background matching, and that the saliency model develops sensitivity to these features. This computational approach provides a powerful tool for investigating the evolutionary dynamics of camouflage and visual perception, with implications for fields ranging from ecology to computer vision."

Explicit mesh representations, while capable of detailed geometry, can be challenging to optimize directly from multi-view images without good initialization. We introduce TetSphere Splatting, a novel hybrid representation that leverages the advantages of both volumetric and mesh-based approaches. Our method represents the scene with a Lagrangian tetrahedral mesh whose vertices are associated with Gaussian splats. During rendering, these splats are projected and blended, with their properties modulated by a neural network conditioned on the tetrahedral mesh structure. This allows us to effectively learn high-quality, explicit geometry while benefiting from the smoothness and regularization imposed by the underlying volumetric mesh. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TetSphere Splatting achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of both reconstruction accuracy and rendering quality, particularly in regions with fine geometric details.

SEC learns to associate visual regions with a rich set of concepts obtained from pre-trained language models and then utilizes these concept embeddings to predict segmentation masks for arbitrary textual queries. Experiments on challenging datasets like COCO and LVIS demonstrate that SEC achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary segmentation, significantly outperforming existing zero-shot and few-shot methods. This work paves the way for more flexible and generalizable semantic segmentation systems capable of understanding and interacting with the visual world in a truly open-ended manner."

This paper addresses the problem of capturing long-range dependencies in neural networks without relying on recurrent or convolutional operations. We propose Non-local Neural Networks as a generic building block for capturing long-range interactions within a sequence of feature maps. Inspired by the classical non-local means filter, our non-local operation computes the response at a position as a weighted sum of the features at all positions. This allows information to propagate directly between distant locations, bypassing the need for layer-by-layer propagation. We demonstrate that integrating non-local blocks into various video classification models improves performance on action recognition benchmarks such as Kinetics and Charades. The simplicity and effectiveness of non-local networks provide a powerful tool for capturing long-range dependencies in a variety of vision tasks."
http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02901v3,Transitive Invariance for Self-supervised Visual Representation Learning,"Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown remarkable progress in learning visual representations without relying on manual annotations. Existing SSL methods often enforce invariance to a set of pre-defined image transformations, but struggle to generalize to unseen transformations or compositions thereof. This paper addresses the limitation of current SSL methods by introducing a novel approach that enforces *transitive invariance*: if image A is invariant to image B, and image B is invariant to image C, then image A should be invariant to image C, even if the direct transformation from A to C was not explicitly seen during training. Our method leverages a contrastive learning framework augmented with a transitivity loss, which encourages the learned representations to respect this transitive property by minimizing the distance between representations of images connected through a chain of transformations. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our transitive invariance approach significantly improves downstream classification and object detection performance compared to state-of-the-art SSL methods, especially when evaluated under novel and complex data augmentations. This highlights the potential of transitive invariance as a powerful inductive bias for robust and generalizable visual representation learning."

We propose a hybrid architecture, named Convolution-Augmented Vision Transformer (CAViT), which incorporates lightweight convolutional layers before the standard Transformer encoder. These initial convolutional layers serve to extract local features and provide a more informative representation of the input image to the subsequent Transformer blocks. Experiments on image classification datasets, including CIFAR-100, CIFAR-10, and a subset of ImageNet, demonstrate that CAViT consistently outperforms vanilla ViTs and other hybrid architectures, especially when training data is limited.

We introduce Inclusive GAN (IGAN), a novel training strategy that combines a re-weighted loss function focusing on under-represented samples with a diversity-promoting regularizer based on feature manifold analysis. IGAN encourages the generator to explore and populate regions of the data space that are currently poorly represented in both the training data and initial generator outputs. Experimental results on benchmark datasets with varying degrees of class imbalance demonstrate that IGAN significantly improves both Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) scores and minority class generation quality, as measured by per-class FID and recall. These improvements highlight the potential of IGAN to create more equitable and comprehensive generative models, leading to fairer and more robust downstream applications."

Current methods often struggle with mode collapse and generating high-fidelity images that accurately reflect the nuances of the conditioning input. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework, Conditional Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (CIMLE), which leverages an implicit generative model trained with a conditional variant of Maximum Likelihood Estimation. CIMLE avoids explicit density estimation, allowing for greater flexibility in modeling complex multimodal distributions. Specifically, we train a generator network to match the distribution of real images conditioned on the input modality by minimizing a learned discrepancy measure between generated and real image features. Our experiments on text-to-image synthesis and semantic image synthesis demonstrate that CIMLE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both image quality and diversity, achieving significant improvements in FID and LPIPS scores. This approach offers a robust and effective solution for multimodal image synthesis, paving the way for more controllable and realistic image generation."

We propose a novel framework, *Audio-LLM*, which utilizes a trainable audio encoder to project raw audio waveforms into a latent space compatible with LLM embeddings, followed by cross-modal attention mechanisms to fuse auditory and textual information. This allows the LLM to directly attend to relevant segments of the audio signal. Our experiments on audio captioning and question answering tasks demonstrate that Audio-LLM achieves comparable or superior performance to systems relying on automatic speech recognition (ASR), particularly in noisy environments. This suggests that LLMs can indeed learn to process raw audio, opening new avenues for end-to-end multimodal systems and bypassing the limitations imposed by reliance on imperfect ASR transcriptions."

http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06588v1,Raising the Cost of Malicious AI-Powered Image Editing,"The proliferation of powerful AI-powered image editing tools presents a significant threat, enabling the creation of increasingly realistic and difficult-to-detect forgeries. A critical challenge is to develop methods that increase the computational and data resources required to generate convincing manipulated images, thereby raising the cost of malicious use. We propose a framework, termed ""Adversarial Perturbation for Provenance Degradation (APPD),"" that introduces imperceptible, targeted perturbations during image capture, designed to disrupt the training and fine-tuning of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models used for image manipulation. APPD leverages an adversarial training scheme to optimize perturbations that maximize the error rate of downstream forgery tasks while maintaining perceptual similarity to the original image. Experiments demonstrate that images pre-processed with APPD require significantly larger training datasets and computational resources to achieve comparable forgery realism compared to unperturbed images, effectively increasing the cost of generating high-quality forgeries by 2-3x. This work offers a proactive defense mechanism to mitigate the potential misuse of AI-powered image editing by increasing the resources required for malicious actors to create convincing forgeries."

A Visualization Study,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in computer vision due to their ability to learn spatial hierarchies and extract features robust to local variations. However, the precise nature and extent of this shift invariance, especially within different layers of the network, remain poorly understood. This paper addresses the problem of visualizing and characterizing the shift invariance properties of CNNs in a layer-wise manner.

By quantifying the similarity between the original and shifted activations using metrics like cosine similarity and normalized cross-correlation, we generate detailed shift invariance maps. Our results reveal that shift invariance generally increases with network depth, but exhibits significant variations depending on the specific layer type, architecture, and the magnitude of the applied shift. Furthermore, we observe that certain layers exhibit localized regions of high and low shift sensitivity, suggesting a more nuanced and spatially dependent form of invariance than previously appreciated. This visualization study provides valuable insights into the internal workings of CNNs and their inherent robustness to spatial transformations, which can inform the design of more efficient and reliable vision systems."

A major challenge in TTA is adapting to diverse and potentially concurrent image corruptions without access to source data or requiring explicit domain identification. We address this by proposing a novel Covariance-aware Feature Alignment (CaFA) method that aligns the feature distribution of the corrupted test data with pre-computed source statistics. CaFA estimates the covariance matrix of the source features and uses it to guide feature alignment during test time, effectively capturing the underlying structure of the source feature space. Furthermore, we introduce a computationally efficient pre-computation strategy for source statistics, enabling real-time adaptation without significant overhead. Experiments on various benchmark datasets with multiple image corruptions demonstrate that CaFA consistently outperforms existing TTA methods, achieving significant accuracy improvements, particularly under severe corruption levels. This underscores the effectiveness of covariance-aware feature alignment and pre-computed statistics for robust and efficient test-time adaptation in the presence of diverse image corruptions."

An Inverse Problem Perspective on Memorization Evaluation,"Overparameterized neural networks are known to memorize training data, potentially leading to poor generalization. Quantifying this memorization, especially in unsupervised models like autoencoders, remains a challenge. This paper addresses the problem of evaluating memorization in overparameterized autoencoders by framing it as an inverse problem. We propose a novel approach that leverages the reconstruction properties of autoencoders to estimate the amount of information retained about specific training examples. Our method involves carefully perturbing the input space around training data points and analyzing the corresponding changes in the reconstructed outputs. By modeling this relationship as an inverse problem, we can estimate the ""memorization score"" for each training sample. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate that our method can effectively identify memorized samples and correlate the memorization score with factors like data complexity and the autoencoder's architecture. Furthermore, we show that samples with high memorization scores are more susceptible to adversarial attacks and contribute less to the learned latent space structure. This work provides a valuable tool for understanding and mitigating memorization in unsupervised representation learning."

We address this problem by introducing NERO (Non-Equivariance Revealed on Orbits), a novel evaluation framework that probes models for equivariance violations by analyzing their behavior along symmetry orbits. NERO perturbs input data according to a specified symmetry transformation, generates an orbit of transformed inputs, and then quantifies the deviation of the model's predictions from the expected equivariant transformation. Experiments on image classification and fluid dynamics tasks demonstrate that NERO effectively reveals subtle non-equivariances in models that exhibit high accuracy and near-invariance, exposing inconsistencies in their learned representations.

A common practice is to ""normalize"" stress by dividing it by area, supposedly to obtain a scale-invariant measure. However, this normalization, while intuitively appealing, obscures the true geometric meaning of stress and can lead to incorrect interpretations and suboptimal results. We demonstrate, through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, that the standard ""normalized stress"" is not a true normalization and that its magnitude is intrinsically linked to the underlying mesh resolution, invalidating comparisons across meshes with different densities. We propose a revised interpretation of stress, focusing on its relationship to the discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator and the local curvature tensor. Our interpretation allows for a more accurate assessment of shape deformation, leading to improved performance in applications such as feature point detection and shape matching. We show that using the unnormalized stress, along with a careful consideration of mesh resolution, yields more robust and meaningful results compared to relying on the commonly used ""normalized"" variant.

This paper investigates the suitability of conditional entropy and mutual information, commonly used to represent aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty respectively, for reliable uncertainty quantification in machine learning models. We propose a novel analytical framework that decomposes these information-theoretic measures into interpretable components, revealing their sensitivity to model calibration, data density, and latent feature representations.

Our findings suggest that while conditional entropy and mutual information can provide useful insights, they should be interpreted cautiously and complemented with alternative uncertainty quantification techniques to ensure robustness and reliability in real-world applications. This work highlights the limitations of relying solely on information-theoretic measures for uncertainty quantification and underscores the need for more nuanced approaches."

http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04415v2,Why Do We Need Weight Decay in Modern Deep Learning?,"Deep learning models, particularly in computer vision, are often over-parameterized, possessing the capacity to memorize training data rather than learning generalizable features. This necessitates regularization techniques, with weight decay being a widely adopted method. However, the precise reasons for its continued effectiveness in modern architectures and training paradigms, such as adaptive optimizers and batch normalization, remain incompletely understood. This paper investigates the role of weight decay in preventing overfitting and promoting generalization in contemporary deep learning. We propose a theoretical framework, supported by empirical evidence, demonstrating that weight decay implicitly controls the effective learning rate and stabilizes the training dynamics, particularly in the presence of adaptive optimizers like Adam. Through extensive experiments on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks using diverse network architectures, we show that carefully tuned weight decay consistently improves performance, especially when combined with batch normalization. Our findings highlight that weight decay acts as a crucial regularizer by preventing excessive growth of network weights and fostering smoother loss landscapes, leading to better generalization. This work provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of weight decay and underscores its importance for achieving optimal performance in modern deep learning."

However, optimizing neural codecs remains challenging, often leading to artifacts and suboptimal rate-distortion trade-offs, particularly at low bitrates. This paper addresses the problem of effectively constraining the latent space of neural compression models to improve generalization and reduce artifacts. We propose Manifold-Constrained Neural Compression (MCNC), a novel reparameterization technique that encourages latent representations to lie on a learned manifold. MCNC utilizes a variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture where the encoder maps the input to a low-dimensional latent space, and a decoder reconstructs the input. Crucially, we introduce a learned manifold within the latent space, constraining the latent variables to reside near this manifold during training. This is achieved by incorporating a manifold regularization term in the loss function that penalizes deviations from the manifold. Experiments on standard image and video compression benchmarks demonstrate that MCNC achieves significant improvements in rate-distortion performance compared to state-of-the-art neural codecs, particularly at low bitrates, while also reducing visual artifacts.

This paper addresses the challenge of representing affordances in a more flexible and continuous manner, enabling agents to reason about potential actions and their associated values across diverse environments. We propose a novel framework that models affordances as General Value Functions (GVFs), where each GVF predicts the expected cumulative reward of executing a particular action policy from a given state. This allows us to learn a rich, state-dependent representation of action possibilities and their associated utilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on simulated robotic manipulation tasks, showing improved generalization to novel objects and environments compared to traditional affordance classification methods. Our GVF-based affordance representation provides a powerful and generalizable framework for robot learning and decision-making, paving the way for more adaptive and intelligent agents."

However, many real-world scenarios involve partial observability and the need to dynamically switch between tasks, presenting significant challenges for HRL agents. This paper addresses the problem of enabling HRL agents to effectively switch between partially-observable and non-observable tasks, both statically and dynamically, leveraging transfer learning to accelerate the learning process. We propose a Combined Model (CM) that integrates a hierarchical policy with an attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant observations and a task-switching module that learns to predict the optimal task sequence based on the current state and history. The CM is further enhanced with a transfer learning strategy that pre-trains the low-level policies on simpler tasks and then fine-tunes them on more complex ones. Our experiments on a suite of simulated robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that the CM significantly outperforms existing HRL methods in terms of learning speed, sample efficiency, and overall performance, especially in dynamic task-switching scenarios. The proposed approach offers a practical solution for deploying HRL agents in real-world environments characterized by partial observability and dynamic task requirements."

This paper addresses the problem of generating human-understandable explanations for the decisions made by visual recognition models. We propose a novel framework that combines concept bottleneck models with a post-hoc explanation module to provide both inherent interpretability and faithful justifications.

However, the effectiveness of these chatbots hinges on various factors, including the nature of the task and the transparency surrounding the chatbot's artificial identity. This study investigates how task complexity and chatbot disclosure (i.e., whether the chatbot is explicitly identified as a bot) moderate consumer responses to text-based chatbots in an e-commerce setting. We conducted a 2x2 between-subjects experiment, manipulating task complexity (simple vs. complex product inquiry) and chatbot disclosure (disclosed vs. undisclosed). Participants interacted with a simulated e-commerce chatbot to complete a purchase-related task. We measured perceived usefulness, satisfaction, and purchase intention. Our findings reveal that chatbot disclosure positively influences consumer satisfaction and purchase intention, particularly when dealing with complex tasks. Conversely, in simple tasks, undisclosed chatbots yield comparable or even slightly better results, suggesting that users may not prioritize knowing the chatbot's identity when the interaction is straightforward. These results highlight the importance of carefully considering task complexity and chatbot disclosure strategies to optimize consumer engagement and achieve desired business outcomes in e-commerce chatbot deployments."

A key question is whether Transformers can emulate aspects of human memory, particularly episodic memory, which involves consciously recalling past experiences and their contexts. This paper investigates whether Transformers develop internal representations analogous to ""memory traces"" – persistent neural changes encoding specific experiences – and whether these traces support episodic-like recall. We introduce a novel methodology for probing Transformer activations, specifically examining the evolution of hidden states across layers in response to sequential input. We then analyze the learned representations using techniques inspired by cognitive neuroscience, searching for evidence of distinct, contextualized memory traces. Our experiments on language modeling and synthetic tasks reveal that Transformers do indeed form identifiable memory traces, which become more distinct and context-specific with increasing layer depth. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these traces can be selectively reactivated by cues related to the original experience, enabling a form of episodic-like recall. These findings suggest that Transformers, despite their architectural simplicity, possess emergent properties that resemble aspects of human episodic memory, opening avenues for more biologically plausible and efficient sequence learning models."

We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with partial and noisy observations. The learned latent space provides a compact and informative representation of the agent's behavior, enabling more robust and accurate goal recognition."
http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11791v1,Inferring Agents Preferences as Priors for Probabilistic Goal Recognition,"Goal recognition aims to infer the intended goal of an agent based on observed behavior. A key challenge lies in effectively incorporating prior knowledge about agent preferences to improve inference accuracy and efficiency, especially in complex and ambiguous scenarios. This paper addresses the problem of learning and representing agent preferences as priors for probabilistic goal recognition. We propose a novel framework that leverages inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to infer a distribution over reward functions from demonstrations of agent behavior, effectively capturing agent preferences. This learned reward distribution is then used to construct a prior distribution over possible goals, which is integrated into a Bayesian goal recognition model. We demonstrate, through extensive experiments on simulated and real-world datasets, that our approach significantly improves goal recognition accuracy and robustness compared to methods using uniform or hand-crafted priors, particularly when dealing with noisy or incomplete observations. By automatically learning and incorporating agent preferences, our method provides a more principled and effective approach to probabilistic goal recognition, enabling more reliable and interpretable agent behavior understanding."
http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.1492v1,Map Learning with Indistinguishable Locations,"Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) relies on the ability to distinguish locations to create consistent maps. However, many environments contain perceptual aliasing, where different locations appear indistinguishable to the robot's sensors, leading to map corruption and localization failure. This paper addresses the problem of learning accurate maps in environments with indistinguishable locations, focusing on mitigating the impact of perceptual aliasing on map consistency. We propose a novel approach that combines a learned similarity metric with a probabilistic mapping framework. The learned metric, trained using contrastive learning, estimates the likelihood that two observations originate from the same location, even if they appear visually similar. This likelihood is then integrated into a Bayesian filter to update the map and robot pose, allowing the system to maintain multiple hypotheses and recover from incorrect loop closures caused by perceptual aliasing. Experiments conducted in simulated and real-world environments with significant perceptual aliasing demonstrate that our approach significantly improves map accuracy and localization robustness compared to traditional SLAM methods. The proposed method offers a practical solution for enabling reliable robotic navigation in challenging, visually ambiguous environments."
http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02986v1,The More the Merrier?! Evaluating the Effect of Landmark Extraction Algorithms on Landmark-Based Goal Recognition,"Landmark-based goal recognition leverages identifiable events within an environment to infer an agent's intended goal. The accuracy of this approach heavily relies on the quality and relevance of extracted landmarks, yet the impact of utilizing multiple, potentially redundant, landmark extraction algorithms remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses the question of whether combining landmarks extracted by different algorithms consistently improves goal recognition performance. We propose a framework to systematically evaluate the effect of integrating landmark sets generated by diverse algorithms, specifically focusing on algorithms based on object permanence, affordance, and spatial relations. We evaluate our framework using a simulated environment and a real-world video dataset, analyzing the precision, recall, and F1-score of goal recognition models trained with various combinations of landmark sets. Our results demonstrate that while combining landmark sets can improve recall, it does not always translate to a consistent increase in precision, and in some cases, leads to a decrease in overall performance due to the introduction of noisy or irrelevant landmarks. This highlights the importance of careful selection and filtering of landmarks when employing multiple extraction algorithms for effective goal recognition."
http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08680v1,Temporally Extended Goal Recognition in Fully Observable Non-Deterministic Domain Models,"Goal recognition aims to infer the intended goal of an agent based on observed behavior. Existing approaches often struggle with non-deterministic environments and focus primarily on instantaneous goal inference, neglecting the temporal evolution of goal likelihoods. This paper addresses the challenge of temporally extended goal recognition in fully observable, non-deterministic domain models, where actions may have multiple possible outcomes. We propose a novel Bayesian approach that integrates a probabilistic planner to model the agent's potential future behavior under each candidate goal, and leverages particle filtering to maintain a belief distribution over goals as the agent's actions unfold over time. The planner accounts for non-determinism by considering multiple possible execution paths. Experiments conducted on benchmark domains demonstrate that our method accurately tracks the evolving probabilities of different goals, achieving significantly higher accuracy and lower latency compared to state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in scenarios with high levels of non-determinism. This work provides a robust framework for understanding agent intent in complex, uncertain environments, enabling more effective human-robot interaction and autonomous system coordination."

This paper addresses the problem of efficiently adding name information into an electronic personal organizer (EPO) using three distinct intelligent interfaces: a rule-based system, a statistical natural language processing (NLP) model, and a hybrid approach combining both. Each interface was designed to parse name strings from various sources (e.g., business cards, emails) and populate corresponding fields in the EPO. We evaluated the interfaces on a dataset of 500 name strings, measuring precision, recall, and F1-score for accurate field assignment. The hybrid approach achieved the highest F1-score (0.92), significantly outperforming the rule-based (0.85) and NLP-only (0.88) systems, demonstrating a marked improvement in both precision and recall. This study provides empirical evidence for the effectiveness of hybrid intelligent interfaces in information capture tasks, offering valuable insights for designing more user-friendly and accurate data entry systems."
http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0310023v1,Application of Kullback-Leibler Metric to Speech Recognition,"Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems rely on accurate modeling of acoustic features and language models. Traditional ASR often employs cross-entropy loss for training, which may not fully capture the distributional nuances between predicted and target speech probabilities. This paper addresses the problem of improving ASR performance by directly minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the predicted posterior distribution of phonemes/words and the target distribution generated from the ground truth transcriptions. We propose a novel training regime that incorporates the KL divergence as a primary loss function, supplementing it with cross-entropy to maintain stability and prevent mode collapse. We investigate the effect of different smoothing techniques on the target distribution to mitigate the impact of sparse training data. Experimental results on the LibriSpeech dataset demonstrate that our KL-divergence-based training approach achieves a relative word error rate (WER) reduction of 5% compared to a baseline system trained solely with cross-entropy. This indicates that directly minimizing the KL divergence can lead to more accurate and robust speech recognition models by better aligning the predicted and target probability distributions."

However, accurately classifying radar targets remains challenging due to factors such as noise, clutter, and the inherent variability of radar signatures. This paper addresses the problem of improving radar target classification performance by leveraging a cognitive diversity framework. Our approach introduces a novel ensemble learning strategy that combines multiple classifiers, each trained on a distinct subset of radar features and employing different machine learning algorithms (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and Convolutional Neural Networks). The diversity is further enhanced by incorporating data augmentation techniques tailored to radar signals, creating a more robust and generalized classification system. Experimental results on both simulated and real-world radar datasets demonstrate that our cognitive diversity framework significantly outperforms individual classifiers and traditional ensemble methods, achieving an average improvement of 8-12% in classification accuracy. This work offers a promising avenue for developing more reliable and accurate radar target classification systems by effectively harnessing the power of diverse perspectives in feature representation and classification methodologies."
http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0171v1,Proposal of Pattern Recognition as a necessary and sufficient Principle to Cognitive Science,"Cognitive science seeks to understand the nature of intelligence, encompassing perception, learning, reasoning, and action. A central challenge lies in identifying unifying principles that can explain the diverse range of cognitive phenomena observed across biological and artificial systems. This paper addresses the question of whether pattern recognition, broadly defined as the ability to detect and categorize regularities in sensory input and internal representations, can serve as a necessary and sufficient principle for cognitive function. We propose a computational framework where all cognitive processes are decomposed into hierarchical pattern recognition modules. These modules learn, represent, and manipulate patterns at various levels of abstraction, from raw sensory data to abstract concepts, using probabilistic inference and predictive coding. We demonstrate, through simulations of several benchmark cognitive tasks, that this pattern recognition-centric architecture can replicate key aspects of human performance, including generalization, robustness to noise, and adaptation to novel environments. Our findings suggest that pattern recognition provides a powerful and parsimonious framework for understanding cognition, potentially unifying diverse theoretical perspectives and offering a foundation for building more intelligent artificial systems."

http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01949v2,Recognizing Plans by Learning Embeddings from Observed Action Distributions,"Inferring the underlying plan behind an agent's observed actions is a fundamental problem in AI, with applications ranging from robotics to human-computer interaction. However, traditional plan recognition approaches often rely on explicit domain knowledge or assume fully observable actions, which limits their applicability in complex, real-world scenarios. This paper addresses the problem of recognizing plans from noisy and incomplete observations of action distributions. We propose a novel embedding-based approach that learns to represent plans and observed action distributions in a shared latent space. Our method trains a neural network to map observed action frequencies to plan embeddings, using a contrastive loss function that encourages similar plans to be mapped to nearby points in the embedding space, regardless of slight variations in observed action distributions. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing baselines in terms of plan recognition accuracy, especially in scenarios with noisy or incomplete observations. This learned embedding space allows for efficient and robust plan recognition from observed action distributions, enabling more effective human-robot collaboration and activity understanding in complex environments."
http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0672v1,Policy Recognition in the Abstract Hidden Markov Model,"Policy recognition, the task of inferring an agent's goals and strategies from observed behavior, is crucial for enabling effective human-robot interaction and autonomous system coordination. Current approaches often struggle with noisy, incomplete, or abstract observations of agent actions, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper addresses the challenge of policy recognition from abstract observations by introducing a novel approach based on the Abstract Hidden Markov Model (AHMM). Our method represents policies as probability distributions over abstract action sequences, learned from expert demonstrations or prior knowledge. We then employ a Bayesian inference framework to estimate the posterior probability of each policy given a sequence of abstract observations, leveraging the AHMM to handle uncertainty and ambiguity in the observation process. Experiments on a simulated navigation task and a real-world manipulation task demonstrate that our AHMM-based approach significantly outperforms traditional Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) methods, particularly in scenarios with high levels of abstraction and observation noise. The proposed method provides a robust and efficient solution for policy recognition in complex environments, paving the way for more intelligent and adaptive autonomous systems."
http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05712v1,Goal Recognition over Imperfect Domain Models,"Goal recognition, the task of inferring an agent's intended goal from observed actions, typically relies on accurate domain models that define the possible actions and their effects. However, real-world environments are often complex and incompletely specified, leading to imperfect domain models that hinder accurate goal recognition. This paper addresses the problem of robust goal recognition in the face of inaccuracies and incompleteness in the domain model. We introduce a novel approach that learns a residual correction model to compensate for discrepancies between the provided domain model and the true environment dynamics. This model is learned jointly with the goal recognition process by incorporating a variational inference framework that marginalizes over possible residual corrections while inferring the agent's goal. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods when the provided domain model is imperfect, achieving higher accuracy and robustness to noise. This work provides a crucial step towards deploying goal recognition systems in complex, real-world environments where perfect domain knowledge is often unattainable."
http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15362v2,Planning Landmark Based Goal Recognition Revisited: Does Using Initial State Landmarks Make Sense?,"Goal recognition aims to infer the most likely intention of an agent based on observed behavior. Planning-based approaches leverage the agent's presumed optimality and domain knowledge to identify goals that best explain the observed actions, often utilizing landmarks – necessary subgoals – to prune the search space. While landmarks derived from potential goal states are widely used, the potential benefit of incorporating landmarks derived from the *initial* state remains underexplored and is the focus of this paper. We investigate whether including initial state landmarks improves the accuracy and efficiency of planning-based goal recognition. We propose a novel algorithm that integrates initial state landmarks into the goal recognition process by identifying goals whose plans not only achieve the goal but also satisfy the identified initial state landmarks. Through extensive experiments on benchmark domains, we demonstrate that incorporating initial state landmarks can significantly improve goal recognition accuracy, particularly in scenarios with sparse observations or ambiguous action sequences, without significantly increasing computational cost. This finding highlights the importance of considering both goal-directed and initial state constraints for effective goal recognition."
http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14426v1,Human-Machine Cooperative Multimodal Learning Method for Cross-subject Olfactory Preference Recognition,"Olfactory preference recognition, crucial for personalized experiences in various applications, faces significant challenges due to the subjective and complex nature of human olfaction. Accurately recognizing olfactory preferences across different individuals remains a difficult task. To address this, we propose a novel Human-Machine Cooperative Multimodal Learning (HMC-MML) method for cross-subject olfactory preference recognition. HMC-MML leverages both human-provided pairwise preference labels and machine-extracted features from electroencephalogram (EEG) and respiration signals during olfactory stimulation. Specifically, we employ a Siamese network architecture trained with a contrastive loss function to learn a shared embedding space for both human and machine representations of olfactory stimuli. This allows the model to effectively integrate human knowledge with machine-learned patterns, leading to improved generalization across subjects. Experimental results on a publicly available olfactory EEG dataset demonstrate that HMC-MML significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-subject olfactory preference recognition, achieving an average accuracy improvement of over 8%. This work highlights the potential of human-machine cooperation in advancing the field of olfactory preference recognition and offers a promising avenue for developing personalized olfactory-driven technologies."
http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01083v1,Sequential Plan Recognition,"Plan recognition, the task of inferring an agent's intentions from observed actions, is crucial for effective human-robot interaction and autonomous systems. A key challenge lies in accurately recognizing plans in dynamic environments where observations arrive sequentially and may be noisy or incomplete. This paper addresses the problem of sequential plan recognition, focusing on maintaining and updating beliefs about an agent's plan as new observations become available. We propose a novel Bayesian approach that integrates hierarchical plan structures with a recurrent neural network (RNN) to model temporal dependencies and handle uncertainty in the observation stream. The RNN learns to predict the likelihood of different actions given the current plan belief, which is then used to update the belief via Bayesian inference. Experiments on synthetic and real-world activity datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness to noisy observations. Our approach achieves a 15% improvement in F1-score compared to state-of-the-art Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based methods in challenging scenarios with partial observability. This work provides a robust and adaptable framework for sequential plan recognition, facilitating more intuitive and reliable human-machine collaboration."

We propose a novel plan recognition framework that combines a hierarchical representation of possible user plans with a probabilistic model for action selection and plan execution. Our model leverages both the temporal dependencies between actions and the semantic relationships between plans to accurately infer the most likely user plan given an observed session. Experiments on a real-world dataset of software usage demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in accurately identifying user plans, achieving a 20% improvement in F1-score. This research provides a valuable tool for developers and researchers seeking to gain deeper insights into user behavior and improve the usability and effectiveness of interactive systems."

However, real-world observations are often partial, providing only a fragmented view of the agent's activities and their temporal relationships. This paper addresses the challenge of plan recognition from *partial-order*, *partially-seen* observations of fluents or actions, a scenario where the observer only perceives a subset of the agent's actions with uncertain temporal ordering. We introduce a novel approach that casts plan recognition as a planning problem, leveraging classical planning techniques to search for the most likely plan consistent with the observed partial information. Our method encodes the observed actions and their partial order constraints as planning goals and uses a probabilistic domain model to capture the likelihood of different plans. Experimental results on benchmark plan recognition datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in handling noisy and incomplete observations, particularly when temporal constraints are sparse. This work advances the state-of-the-art in robust plan recognition, enabling more effective collaboration between humans and AI agents in complex, real-world environments."
http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2295v1,Recognition Networks for Approximate Inference in BN20 Networks,"Bayesian networks (BNs) offer a powerful framework for probabilistic reasoning under uncertainty, but exact inference in complex BNs is often computationally intractable. Approximate inference methods, such as variational inference, provide a scalable alternative, but require careful design and can be computationally expensive themselves. This paper addresses the challenge of efficient approximate inference in BN2O networks, a class of BNs frequently encountered in object recognition and scene understanding. We propose a novel approach that leverages recognition networks, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to directly approximate the posterior distribution over latent variables in the BN2O network. The CNN is trained to map observed evidence to parameters of a tractable distribution (e.g., Gaussian), enabling fast and amortized inference. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our recognition network-based approach achieves comparable or superior accuracy to traditional variational inference methods while significantly reducing inference time. This accelerated inference capability enables the deployment of complex BN2O models in real-time computer vision applications."
